    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" width = '75' alt = "JPG">

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are good for animations, but not for pictures</p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt = "GIF">

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are good for anything that is NOT a photo. PNG photo with same quality as JPG would be bigger.
        PNG has opacity so good for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt = "PNG">

    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <p>SVG are not pixel-based but vector-based, so you can scale them to any dimension and will not lose quality.
        Makes them really good for responsive design, and are good for all the same use cases as PNGs. Should try to 
        use them as much as possible. Only problem with SVG is that for them to look the same in all browsers you need to
        convert any text fields to outlines using image editors (Illustrator or Sketch). If the image has a lot of text 
        like a screenshot of something, then the size of the SVG would get really big. There you should use a PNG.
